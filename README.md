# stoplight
2-way stoplight system made using Arduino

Stoplight is an Arduino project for a traffic light system. This system alternates the right of way for a 2-way street. There are 5 lights on each side of the "street." Two of the lights are for pedestrians (red and white) and three of them are for drivers (red, yellow, green).

As a pedestrian, there is also a button you can press that will cause the light to change (within three seconds) and allow you to pass. Once a few seconds have elapsed, the light indicating that pedestrians have the right of way changes from a solid white to a blinking red. Once the red light stops blinking (and is just a solid red) pedestrians for that particular side no longer have the right of way.
